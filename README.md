# Project Happy Thoughts API

Created my own API for the Happy Thoughts project that was done some weeks ago. 
This includes GET, POST and PATCH methods. 

## The problem

I made use of the Mongoose documentation to see how to add limits to the responses and adding hearts. 
It was interesting to connect the backend to the previously created frontend project and to have to make a few tweaks to make it work. Nice to have the whole picture in view.
